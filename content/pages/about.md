subtitle: "“If you really want to\_hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.”J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye"

I have 2 young children who are sparks of light and for whom the site is named.  This website is a creative outlet from my day job and is meant to help other busy parents find ways to keep their kids educated and entertained
